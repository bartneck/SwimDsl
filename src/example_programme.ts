### Welcome ###################################################################

# swimDSL is part of a larger project, swiML! Information about the swiML
# project can be found online at https://swiml.org

### Basic Instructions ########################################################

# Writing your first swim instruction:
# Basic swim instructions are written using a distance and a stroke name.
200 Freestyle
100 Breaststroke

# Stroke names can be written in full form as shown above, short form,
# and abbreviated form. The following three instructions are equivalent.
50 Freestyle
50 Free
50 Fr

# Same again for other strokes. I prefer to use the full form, so I will
# continue to use it for the rest of this tutorial. In general I recommend
# choosing one form (full, short, or abbreviated) and sticking with it
# throughout your whole programme for concistancy.
100 Backstroke
100 Back
100 Bk

100 Breaststroke
100 Breast
100 Br

100 Butterfly
100 Fly
100 Fl

# Please note that SwimDSL is case-sensitive, so the following is
# considered an error!
100 butterfly

# Pay attention to the red underline. The SwimDSL editor will provide
# these underlines whenever there is a mistake in your programme.
# Try hovering your cursor over the underlined text. The editor will
# provide you with an error message and often a button to correct your
# mistake too.


### Stroke Modifiers ###########################################################

# One can specify stroke types (kick, pull, or drill) after the stroke name.
100 Backstroke Kick
50 Breaststroke Pull

# When performing kick and pull, it is common to use special gear. These
# can be specified using the + symbol. You can specify multiple pieces
# of gear by separating each one with a space. The SwimDSL editor will
# show you an error message if you make an invalid combination of gear
# for the specified stroke type.
100 Backstroke Kick + Fins Board
200 Freestyle + Fins
50 Freestyle Pull + Buoy Paddles


### Swimming Intensity #########################################################

# To specify intensity for a particular instruction, use the @ symbol.
# Intensity is specified as a percentage of the swimmer's perceived rate of
# excertion.
100 Backstroke @ 60%
50 Backstroke @ 90%

# We can slo specify increasing or decreasing effort using a hyphen and a
# greater-than symbol (->).
50 Butterfly @ 55% -> 75%
100 Freestyle @ 80% -> 50%

# Sometimes its nice to use words rather than numbers to specify pace.
# Pace names can be defined using the pace keyword and a specific
# percentage. I recomend placing these definitions close to the top of
# the file before the first instruction.
pace easy = 45%
pace medium = 65%
pace hard = 90%

150 Backstroke @ medium
200 Freestyle @ easy -> hard

# Note that it is an error to use a pace name that isn't defined
50 Butterfly @ max

# Pace names must only contain letters. Numbers, spaces, and other
# symbols are not allowed.


### Resting ####################################################################

# There are multiple ways to specify rest in swimDSL. Currently, these are rest
# since the start of the instruction, and rest after the end of the instruction.
# These are both written as durations, in minutes and seconds, for example, 1:00
# specifies one minute.

# Rest since start indicates that the instruction should be completed in less
# time than the duration specified, and any remaining time is rest time. To
# specify rest since start, use the on keyword.
2 x 125 Breaststroke on 2:30
4 x 25 Freestyle on 0:25

# In the above example, the swimmer should not start the second 125 breaststroke
# until two and a half minutes have passed since they started the first 125.
# Similarly, they should not start their next 25 Freestyle until twenty five
# seconds since they started their previous length.

# To specify a fixed duration of rest (rest after finish), use the rest keyword
1:00 rest
0:30 rest


### Repeition ##################################################################

# To repeat an instruction multiple times, use the x symbol.
8 x 25 Freestyle on 0:30
4 x 75 Backstroke

# When using repitition and pace together on an individual instruction,
# the time applies to each individual repitition, rather than grouping
# them all into a single item.

# The following should take a total of four minutes, rather than just one.
4 x 75 Freestyle on 1:00

# The following instruction builds pace six times, over each 100 rather
# than once over the full 600
6 x 100 Freestyle @ 60% -> 80%


### Grouping Instructions ######################################################

# Instructions can be grouped together to apply a repition, pace, stroke
# type, or gear to many different instructions as a sinle one.
2 x {
  50 Backstroke
  100 Freestyle
  50 Breaststroke
  0:30 rest
} Pull + Buoy @ 70%

# When specifying a pace on a grouped isntruction, the pace applies to
# the whole group as a single item.

# The following medely should be swum in under two minutes, rather than
# having 2 minutes for each length.
{
  25 Butterfly
  25 Backstroke
  25 Breaststroke
  25 Freestyle
} on 2:00

# The following instruction builds pace slowly over the 500 total,
# rather than five times over each 100
{
  100 Freestyle
  100 Backstroke
  100 Freestyle
  100 Breaststroke
  100 Freestyle
} @ 70% -> 90%

# Groups and repitition can be infinitely nested. The following is perfectly
# valid SwimDSL.
2 x {
  50 Freestyle
  2 x {
    50 Backstroke
    2 x {
      50 Breaststroke
      2 x {
        50 Butterfly
        2 x 50 Freestyle
      }
    }
  }
}


### Additional Strokes #########################################################

# The earlier instruction of 25 butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke,
# and freestyle make up an individual medely and can be written more
# concisely using the IndividualMedley stroke.
100 IndividualMedley on 2:00

# To specify that the swimmer has the freedom to choose any stroke of
# their liking, use the Choice stroke.
100 Choice

# Number strokes indicate the swimmer should swim their first, second,
# third, or fourth favourite stoke.
100 NumberOne
100 NumberTwo
100 NumberThree
100 NumberFour


### Set Headers ################################################################

# You can create section headings using the > symbol. The text you specify will
# be copied verbatim into the document in a bold font.
> Warm up
100 Freestyle

> Set One
4 x 200 Backstroke


### Extras #####################################################################

# It is very usefull for SwimDSL to know information such as the length
# of the pool the programme is being swum in, and the unit that all
# distances are specified in. This allows for the rendered output to show
# the total distance and number of laps in the programme. These are best
# specified at the very top of the file, and should not appear more than once!

set PoolLength 25
set LengthUnit "metres"


# As well as specifying pool length and the unit used for length, one can
# specify information about the programme itself, when it was written, and
# who it was written by.

set Title "Programme Title"
set Author "Programme Author"
set Description "Programme description"
set Date "2025-09-22"  # Must conform to YYYY-MM-DD


# Additional information can be added to configure the programme render. These
# options are shown below with their default values.

set Align True
set NumeralSystem "decimal"
set HideIntro False
set LayoutWidth 50

# Finally, you should have noticed already, any text preceeded by a
# hash symbol (#) is a comment, and completely ignored when rendering.

# And thats it! You are now well versed in SwimDSL. Make sure to keep
# the order of you instructions correct, that is repititions, distance,
# stroke name, stroke type, required gear, and finally pace. If your use
# these in the wrong order, the editor will show you an error message.

# Go fourth!

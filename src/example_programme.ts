### Welcome ###################################################################

# swimDSL is part of a larger project, swiML! Information about the swiML
# project can be found online at https://swiml.org

### Basic Instructions ########################################################

# Writing your first swim instruction:
# Basic swim instructions are written using a distance and a stroke name.
200 Freestyle
100 Breaststroke

# Stroke names can be written in full form as shown above, short form,
# and abbreviated form. The following three instructions are equivalent.
50 Freestyle
50 Free
50 Fr

# Same again for other strokes. I prefer to use the full form, so I will
# continue to use it for the rest of this tutorial. In general I recommend
# choosing one form (full, short, or abbreviated) and sticking with it
# throughout your whole programme for concistancy.
100 Backstroke
100 Back
100 Bk

100 Breaststroke
100 Breast
100 Br

100 Butterfly
100 Fly
100 Fl

# Please note that SwimDSL is case-sensitive, so the following is
# considered an error!
100 butterfly

# Pay attention to the red underline. The SwimDSL editor will provide
# these underlines whenever there is a mistake in your programme.
# Try hovering your cursor over the underlined text. The editor will
# provide you with an error message and often a button to correct your
# mistake too.


### Stroke Modifiers ###########################################################

# One can specify stroke types (kick, pull, or drill) after the stroke name.
100 Backstroke Kick
50 Breaststroke Pull

# When performing kick and pull, it is common to use special equipment. These
# can be specified using the + symbol. You can specify multiple pieces
# of equipment by separating each one with a space. The SwimDSL editor will
# show you an error message if you make an invalid combination of equipment
# for the specified stroke type.
100 Backstroke Kick + Fins Board
200 Freestyle + Fins
50 Freestyle Pull + PullBuoy Pads

# It is also common to specify lengths as being swum completely underwater or
# only breathing after a certain number of strokes.
25 Freestyle underwater
100 Freestyle breathe 5


### Swimming Intensity #########################################################

# To specify intensity for a particular instruction, use the @ symbol.
# Intensity is specified as a percentage of the swimmer's perceived rate of
# excertion.
100 Backstroke @ 60%
50 Backstroke @ 90%

# We can also specify increasing or decreasing effort using a hyphen and a
# greater-than symbol (->).
50 Butterfly @ 55% -> 75%
100 Freestyle @ 80% -> 50%

# Sometimes its nice to use words rather than numbers to specify pace.
# Pace names can be defined using the pace keyword and a specific
# percentage. I recomend placing these definitions close to the top of
# the file before the first instruction.
pace easy = 45%
pace medium = 65%
pace hard = 90%

150 Backstroke @ medium
200 Freestyle @ easy -> hard

# Note that it is an error to use a pace name that isn't defined
50 Butterfly @ max

# Pace names must only contain letters. Numbers, spaces, and other
# symbols are not allowed.


### Resting ####################################################################

# There are multiple ways to specify rest in swimDSL.

# The first two ways to do so are rest since the start of the instruction, and
# rest after the end of the instruction. These are both written as durations,
# in minutes and seconds, for example, 1:00 specifies one minute.

# Rest since start indicates that the instruction should be completed in less
# time than the duration specified, and any remaining time is rest time. To
# specify rest since start, use the on keyword.
2 x 125 Breaststroke on 2:30
4 x 25 Freestyle on 0:25

# In the above example, the swimmer should not start the second 125 breaststroke
# until two and a half minutes have passed since they started the first 125.
# Similarly, they should not start their next 25 Freestyle until twenty five
# seconds since they started their previous length.

# To specify a fixed duration of rest (rest after finish), use the with keyword
100 Freestyle with 0:15
50 Butterfly with 1:00

# In addition to duration based rests, it is possible to specify a rest
# time as the number of swimmers to finish the instruction before a swimmer
# starts to swim again, this can be achieved with the in-out keyword.
4 x 50 Butterfly in-out 3
2 x 400 Freestyle in-out 2

# In the examples above, a swimmer should not start their next 50 Butterfly until
# 3 other swimmers have finished the same 50 Butterfly rep.
# In the same vein, a swimmer should not start their second 400 Freestyle until
# 2 other swimmers have finished the first 400 Freestyle.


### Repeition ##################################################################

# To repeat an instruction multiple times, use the x symbol.
8 x 25 Freestyle on 0:30
4 x 75 Backstroke

# When using repitition and pace together on an individual instruction,
# the time applies to each individual repitition, rather than grouping
# them all into a single item.

# The following should take a total of four minutes, rather than just one.
4 x 75 Freestyle on 1:00

# The following instruction builds pace six times, over each 100 rather
# than once over the full 600
6 x 100 Freestyle @ 60% -> 80%


### Grouping Instructions ######################################################

# Instructions can be grouped together to apply a repition, pace, stroke
# type, or equipment to many different instructions as a single one.
2 x {
  50 Backstroke
  100 Freestyle
  50 Breaststroke
  0:30 rest
} Pull + PullBuoy @ 70%

# When specifying a pace on a grouped isntruction, the pace applies to
# the whole group as a single item.

# The following medely should be swum in under two minutes, rather than
# having 2 minutes for each length.
{
  25 Butterfly
  25 Backstroke
  25 Breaststroke
  25 Freestyle
} on 2:00

# The following instruction builds pace slowly over the 500 total,
# rather than five times over each 100
{
  100 Freestyle
  100 Backstroke
  100 Freestyle
  100 Breaststroke
  100 Freestyle
} @ 70% -> 90%

# Groups and repitition can be infinitely nested. The following is perfectly
# valid SwimDSL.
2 x {
  50 Freestyle
  2 x {
    50 Backstroke
    2 x {
      50 Breaststroke
      2 x {
        50 Butterfly
        2 x 50 Freestyle
      }
    }
  }
}


### Additional Strokes #########################################################

# The earlier instruction of 25 butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke,
# and freestyle make up an individual medely and can be written more
# concisely using the IndividualMedley stroke.
100 IndividualMedley on 2:00

# To specify that the swimmer has the freedom to choose any stroke of
# their liking, use the Choice stroke.
100 Choice

# Number strokes indicate the swimmer should swim their first, second,
# third, or fourth favourite stoke.
100 NumberOne
100 NumberTwo
100 NumberThree
100 NumberFour


### Additional instruction details #############################################

# While it is possible to model a large variety of swim programs using swimDSL,
# there will always be different instructions that cannot be expressed with the
# options provided here. To solve this it is possible to provide a description
# to an instruction with extra details
100 Freestyle Kick -- "Focus on pointed toes"

# It is also possible to provide a description for a set of repetitions to apply
# to all instructions being repeated
4 x {
100 Kick
50 Freestyle
} -- "Focus on pointed toes"

# In this example the extra description of "Focus on pointed toes" would apply to
# both the 100 Kick and the 50 Freestyle.


### Additional Distances #######################################################

# In addition to simply writing the distance, it is possible to specify the
# distance for an instruction as a number of laps or as a set amount of time.
1 lap Butterfly
4 laps Backstroke
5:00 Freestyle

# For the first two examples, the swimmer should swim 1 lap of Butterfly which in
# the case of a 25m pool would be 25 Butterfly. Similarly 4 laps of Backstroke
# would be the same as 100 Backstroke in a 25m pool. For 5:00 Freestyle, the
# swimmer should swim Freestyle for a continuous 5 minutes.


### Set Headers ################################################################

# You can create section headings using the > symbol. The text you specify will
# be copied verbatim into the document in a bold font.
> Warm up
100 Freestyle

> Set One
4 x 200 Backstroke


### Extras #####################################################################

# It is very usefull for SwimDSL to know information such as the length
# of the pool the programme is being swum in, and the unit that all
# distances are specified in. This allows for the rendered output to show
# the total distance and number of laps in the programme. These are best
# specified at the very top of the file, and should not appear more than once!

set PoolLength 25
set LengthUnit "metres"


# As well as specifying pool length and the unit used for length, one can
# specify information about the programme itself, when it was written, and
# who it was written by.

set Title "Programme Title"
set Author "Programme Author"
set Description "Programme description"
set Date "2025-09-22"  # Must conform to YYYY-MM-DD


# Additional information can be added to configure the programme render. These
# options are shown below with their default values.

set Align True
set NumeralSystem "decimal"
set HideIntro False
set LayoutWidth 50

# Finally, you should have noticed already, any text preceeded by a
# hash symbol (#) is a comment, and completely ignored when rendering.

# Go fourth!
